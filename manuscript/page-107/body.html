Twenty, thirty, forty years from now, a withered, snuffy, oddly dressed old man will sit, perchance, in front of some Paris café, sipping his eau sucrée or his syruped vermouth, and the boulevardier who passes by will say to his friend; ‘That is Schnaebele.’</p><p>“‘And who is Schnaebele?’ the friend will inquire, wonderingly.</p><p>“‘Why, have you forgotten your history? The hero of the Schnaebele incident—in 1887—or ’78—which was it? When we were so near going to war with Germany.’</p><p>“‘Ah, bah!’ his friend will reply; ‘un marron glacé! Qu’est-ce que tu me donnes!’</p><p>“And that is what it is to be an incident.”—Puck, <em>May 4th, 1887</em>.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
