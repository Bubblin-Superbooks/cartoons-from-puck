The employers, having power, have misused it. They will likewise misuse power. What could be expected otherwise? Where they have the upper hand, they will tyrannize. They will strike and paralyze business, not only to enforce just demands, but to enforce unjust demands. Their employers will use the power of money to retaliate as best they may. A war, a veritable Civil War is begun, to which who can see the end?”</p></div> </div>
