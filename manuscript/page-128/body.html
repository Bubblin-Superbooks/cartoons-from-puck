That he and his partner McGlynn did not accomplish the mischief they set out to do was no fault of theirs. When this cartoon was drawn, June 15th, 1887, they seemed to be perilously near to attaining their end. The reason that they failed was that, as is usual in this country, Horse Sense ultimately triumphed over Hysteria.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
