It is disheartening—it is hard on a truly great editor. And yet to such misery are some of our most prominent moulders subjected. They toil unceasingly to show to President Cleveland the error of his ways—giving the public an incidental glimpse—and the more they show it to him, the less he sees it—and the less the public sees it. He goes on and does his work as he promised to do it, and the public seems to be thoroughly well pleased with him. But it is hard on the moulders.”</p><p>NAPOLEON’S RETREAT.</p></div> </div>
