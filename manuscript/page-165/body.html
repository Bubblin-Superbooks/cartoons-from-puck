This was a mistake, tactically—that it was also a mistake, practically, time may show. Tammany had little difficulty in showing that, whatever she might have done in the past, she had now taken to governing New York uncommonly well and uncommonly cheaply. That was enough to satisfy the minds of most citizens as to the advisability of renewing the contract with Tammany; and in 1890 and in 1892 Tammany riveted her rule upon New York as tight as a collar on a steamboat shaft. No matter what that rule may be, good, bad or indifferent, it is factional rule, and as such, to Puck’s thinking, dangerous and founded on injustice. If it ever brings mischief to New York, we must not forget that the responsibility lies with the theorists who made opposition hopeless by persistently conducting it upon untenable grounds.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
