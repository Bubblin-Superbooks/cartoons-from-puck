In the convention that nominated Mr. Garfield he had been, next to General Grant, Garfield’s most dangerous rival—or, perhaps it would be more correct to say that he might have been, had the time been ripe for him to exert his full strength. So, when President Garfield died, and Mr. Arthur, who had been an unpopular candidate for the Vice-Presidency, succeeded to the Presidential chair, two apparent probabilities interested the populace. It was assumed, of course, that a President must be a candidate for re-election and under such circumstances it was thought that in all likelihood Mr. Blaine would be far more powerful in the next convention than a President who owed his elevation to mere accident.</p></div> </div>
