<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Mr. Cleveland first became President in 1885, he put into practice a much broader theory of Civil Service Reform than certain active politicians of his party had any use for. Nor did he show any great eagerness to shower offices and honors upon those members of his party who had proved false to him in the campaign of the previous year. On December 23rd, 1885, Puck pictured these unfortunates as Christmas “Waits,” standing outside the White House in the wintry cold, and raising their voices in plaintive song:</p><p>“God rest you, merry gentlemen,<br>May nothing you dismay;<br>Remember us poor spoilsmen left<br>This blessed Christmas Day.</p><p>“Since Christmas comes but once a year,<br>Oh, let us share your Christmas cheer,<br>And chuck one little office here<br>On Christmas Day in the A. M.”</p></div> </div>
