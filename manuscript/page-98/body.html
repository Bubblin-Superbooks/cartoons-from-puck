At least, he was a mortal who strove hard to be more than other mortals, and who strove from a sense of duty. We may—and must—hold the effort futile; yet we may respect the spirit that prompted it. We Americans have no use for Kings; and we have ideas as to popular government that King Wilhelm of Prussia, later Emperor of Germany, would never understand. But let us consider that it would be well for us if we had a few statesmen, among those who are governing us on speculation, who would look on their responsibilities as this dead European monarch did on his. He knew that his place was greater than he was, and he tried to make himself fit for it. And, now that he is dead, his people mourn a brave man gone; if they are to have Kings or Emperors to rule them in the future, they will go far before they find a better man of his kind.”—Puck, <em>March 21st, 1888</em>.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
